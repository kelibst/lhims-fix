Right now we have a scirpt that is to help me extract the bio data of patients from the data in the folder data into a new databse but i want to change that plan and intead make the script work in a bigger plan, where our mvp is that we will use the opd and ipd data that we have extracted to generate a bio data for all of our patients then also include some information abou t opd and ipd so my idea is like at the initial end we will have a major search part where the user searches a patien is able to see the data that we can extract from the data folder such as the bio data as well as the opd visit the date and things like in a list they click on it then it can lead them to a link to the full opd pdf that we have downloaded 
and when they click on an ipd it can link them to the full link of the ipd we have implemented. 
let's plan how to achieve that
