awesome, with our current implementaion will the subsequent run of the command npm restart the extration from the beginning or try to see if we don't already have that data extracted and move on to the next level? lets plan and implement without breaking the current implementations

I want you to help again extract some other data. apart from opd and ipd we have some other data, I need to plan and extract it just like we are doing with the opd and ipd right now.
